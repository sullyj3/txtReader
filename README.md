# txtReader

Have you ever opened a website, looked at the text, and thought any of the following?

- "This page is hard to read!"
- "The lines are too long!"
- "There's not enough contrast!"
- "Everything's squished together!"

TxtReader is a simple page that displays plain text with nice, readable typography.

Simply paste in the text you want to read. Alternatively you can choose a text file from your local machine.
